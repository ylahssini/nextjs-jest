This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This is an example of my experiment on Next.js with Jest and Enzyme. This is my first time to do it.

To launch the app in development, you will need just to type:
`npm run dev`
or
`yarn dev`

To test the app, you will need to use this command:
`npm run test`
or
`yarn test`

To see the coverage:
`npm run test:coverage`
or
`yarn test:coverage`

Don't forget install all modules based on package.json:
`npm i`
